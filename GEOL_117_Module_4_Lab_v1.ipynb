This environment doesn't have every Python package installed by default, so sometimes we need to install additional packages to extend its capabilities. The command `!pip install` is used to install these packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `pip` stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\" and is a package manager for Python. When you use the `!` before a command in a Colab cell, it tells Colab to execute that command as a shell command (like you would in a terminal).\n",

It can help the viewer to better understand the geographical distribution and relation of the data points.\n",

It provides tools to transform and project your geospatial data, allowing you to visualize data in a way that is appropriate for its spatial distribution. For example, it will help us project our data into the Transverse Mercator CRS, which is suitable for mapping small regions. Additionally, `cartopy` offers various features to enhance our maps, such as adding coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.\n",
