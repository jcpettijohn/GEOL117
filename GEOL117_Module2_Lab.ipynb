        "The Earth's crust is not a static, monolithic structure. Instead, it consists of various tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. This theory, known as **Plate Tectonics**, posits that these plates are in continuous motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the primary locations where these plates move apart is at the **mid-ocean ridges**. These underwater mountain ranges are sites where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity. As magma rises to the surface, it solidifies, becoming part of the expanding seafloor.\n",
        "\n",
        "An intriguing aspect is the periodic reversals of the Earth's magnetic field, termed **geomagnetic reversals**. As molten rock solidifies at these ridges, the magnetic minerals within align with the current direction of the Earth's magnetic field. This alignment creates a pattern of magnetic anomalies on the ocean floor, parallel to the ridge, recording the history of these magnetic reversals.\n",

When magma solidifies at the ridge, it locks in the current magnetic polarity. By looking at the sequence of magnetic polarities in the rocks, we can get an idea of the history of magnetic field reversals.\n",

        "**Age Estimation**: We associate each magnetic reversal with an age. For simplicity, in our synthetic data, we'll assume that these reversals occur randomly between every 0.1 to 1 million years. Therefore, as we move away from the ridge and encounter different magnetic polarities, we're essentially moving back in time through Earth's magnetic history.\n",
