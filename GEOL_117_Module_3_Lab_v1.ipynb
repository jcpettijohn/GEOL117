Maps are an integral part of many fields, including urban planning, environmental studies, and even in our daily lives for directions and understanding local geographies. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create an interactive map centered around Champaign, IL, and visualize specific regions within it.\n",

        "## Step 1: Setting Up Your Workspace\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we begin, it's crucial to set up your environment with the necessary libraries. These libraries are like toolkits that provide specific functions to simplify our tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importing Libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **folium**: A powerful Python library for creating interactive maps. Think of it as your canvas and brush for painting geographical data.\n",

        "## Step 2: Defining Our Mapping Function\n",
        "\n",
        "To simplify the map creation process, we've defined a custom function named `create_site_map`. This function will be the workhorse of our activity:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **center_coords**: Central point around which our map will be centered. Given in the form of a tuple containing latitude and longitude.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **extent_N and extent_S**: These parameters define how far north and south, respectively, from the center point we wish to visualize. The regions are represented by colored circles on the map.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Inside the function, we set up our base map, define the visualization's extent, add tile layers for aesthetics, and incorporate controls to toggle between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 3: Visualizing Champaign, IL\n",
        "\n",
        "In this final step, we'll put our function to the test! The provided coordinates `(40.1100, -88.2272)` are for Champaign, IL. By using our previously defined function, we will generate an interactive map centered on Champaign:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **blue circle** represents the northern extent, spanning 10 kilometers from the center.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- The **red circle** represents the southern extent, spanning 5 kilometers from the center.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you run the code, you'll see a detailed map of Champaign, IL. Feel free to zoom in/out and explore the area. You can also modify the center coordinates or extents to visualize different regions.\n",

Understanding the projection and extent of your data is crucial because it ensures that the data aligns correctly on a map.
